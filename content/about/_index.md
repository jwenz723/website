{{< figure src="/images/me-and-the-kids.jpg" title="Who I Am" >}}

I am a fun, loving, confident, and intelligent man. I don't typically like to talk
myself up, but that is the purpose of this page. I am calm, easygoing, and quick
to forgive.

In my 30+ years of life there aren't many
people that I can think of that I didn't get along with. Everyone has trials, why
not help each other when we can? 

I believe that we all make mistakes to help us learn. By continuing to move
forward and forgive ourselves for our mistakes we will continue to become better.

I enjoy writing code, watching movies, yoga, mountain biking, snowboarding, swimming,
traveling, playing guitar, dog training, and playing with toy dolls, cars, and balls
with my kids. I enjoy doing most things as long as there is a fun or adventurous
attitude associated with the activity.

I've been married to my beautiful wife since 2016. We had our first girl child
in 2020 and identical twin boys in 2022. Three kids in 21 months and all during
the Covid-19 craziness! It has been quite a fun adventure.

Everyone always
asks me what it is like to have twins.
My response is always "it's double the fun and double the trouble." Having
kids is like opening a door to receive blessings. Having twins is like opening a double
door! It isn't something I'd recommend for the faint-hearted, but I wouldn't
trade it for anything. My family means the world to me. Everything I do, I do for them.

Having kids has helped me to learn and grow in ways that I previously wasn't aware
that I needed. It is amazing how priorities can change so quickly and easily when
time becomes a limited commodity. It really helps to put into perspective what is
and is not essential to daily life. I believe that it is always possible to have time
to do the things that we really want to do as long as we remain focused.
