This repository contains the code used to generate the https://jeff.wenzbauer.com website.
This website serves primarily as a way to digitally manage my resume.

I maintain my resume using markdown syntax because it is a syntax very familiar to myself and most developers.
I can easily convert the resume into a PDF or word doc using the steps documented
[here](https://mszep.github.io/pandoc_resume/).
